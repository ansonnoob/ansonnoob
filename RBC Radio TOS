### Privacy Notice

**Last Updated: January 24, 2026**

RBC Radio is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, and protect limited information when you visit https://radio.rbctelevision.org (the "Website").

1. **Information We Collect**  
   - Automatically Collected Data: We collect standard server logs, including your IP address, browser type, device information, pages visited, time and date of access, and referring URLs. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the Service.  
   - Geolocation Data: We use MaxMind GeoIP or similar services to estimate your approximate location (country/region level) based on your IP address for basic analytics and content relevance (e.g., regional statistics). We do not collect precise GPS data.  
   - We do not collect personal identifiers such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers unless you voluntarily provide them (e.g., via a contact form).

Children's Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information without your consent, please contact us immediately.

2. **How We Use Your Information**

   - For internal analytics and statistical purposes (e.g., audience size, geographic distribution).  
   - To detect and prevent technical issues or abuse.

3. **Sharing and Disclosure**  
   We do not sell your personal data to advertisers, third-party marketers, or any other parties. We may share aggregated, anonymized statistics (e.g., total listeners per region) with partners or for public reporting, but never in a way that identifies individuals.  
   We may disclose information if required by law, to protect our rights, or in response to valid legal requests.

4. **Data Security**  
   We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the data we collect, though no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

5. **Third-Party Services**  
   The Website may use third-party tools (e.g., MaxMind for GeoIP, basic analytics providers). Their use is governed by their own privacy policies.

6. **Your Rights**  
   Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your data (e.g., access or deletion). Contact us to inquire.
